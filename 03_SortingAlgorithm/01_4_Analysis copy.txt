-- Total Swaps          : size - 1 (in the best case when the array is already sorted)
-- Total Comparisons    : size(size - 1) / 2 --> Worst-case scenario
-- Time Complexity      : O(nÂ²) in worst and average cases
-- Stable?              : Yes, Bubble Sort is stable (same value elements retain their order)
-- Adaptive?            : Yes (if optimized), with a flag to detect if the array is already sorted
